# Calculator GUI using Java

The Java calculator GUI consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The GUI is designed to display the calculator's input and output using a text field.

The calculator's GUI typically includes a set of buttons that allow users to input numerical and functional values. The numerical values are usually represented as buttons labeled 0 through 9, while the functional values are typically represented by buttons labeled with symbols such as +, -, x, /, and =. Additionally, a decimal point button is often included to allow users to input decimal values.

The GUI layout of the calculator is usually organized in a grid-like fashion, with the numerical and functional buttons arranged in rows and columns. The input and output display is usually located at the top of the calculator and is implemented using a text field. The text field is used to display the input values and the results of the calculations performed by the calculator.

Overall, the Java calculator GUI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly and easily perform basic arithmetic operations.
